ed, it immediately

cheeks."

pouches run empty,
it raises its tail to gather electri�
city from the
atmosphere."

seen, it becomes
easier to spot, for some reason,
on the night of a 
full moon."

quiet, remote
mountains, this type of fairy has

left to extract
from the bug, the mushrooms on its
back leave spores
on the bug's egg."

eats appear only
at night, so it sleeps in a hole
in a tree until
night falls."
49,6,9,"The scales it
scatters will
paralyze anyone who touches them,
making that person
unable to stand."

ground and chews
on tree roots, sticking its head

triplets dig over
60 miles below sea level. No one

that sparkle. When
it sees a shiny object, the gold

elegant appearance
lies a barbaric side. It will tear

fully along on the
quiet, slow-moving rivers and lakes

the world."

scroll shows that
people were attracted to its
movement as it ran
through prairies."
60,6,9,"The swirl on its
belly is its
insides showing through the skin.
It looks clearer
after it eats."
61,6,9,"Though it is
skilled at walk�
ing, it prefers to live underwater
where there is
less danger."
62,6,9,"It can use its
well-developed
arms and legs to run on the surface
of the water for a
split second."
63,6,9,"It hypnotizes
itself so that it
can teleport away when it senses

anything that
moves, it immediately flings
its vine at the
object."

razor-sharp leaves, slicing up
any unlucky object
nearby for food."

this POKeMON's
body, even the hardest object
will melt into
nothing."

prey."

sturdy bodies,
they bash against each other in a

into huge rocks."
76,6,9,"Its rock-like body
is so durable,
even high-powered dynamite blasts
fail to scratch
its rugged hide."
77,6,9,"Training by
jumping over grass
that grows longer every day has made
it a world-class
jumper."

gallop. The faster
it goes, the long� er the swaying
flames of its mane
will become."
79,6,9,"It is always so
absent-minded that
it won't react, even if its
flavorful tail is
bitten."
80,6,9,"An attached
SHELLDER won't let
go because of the tasty flavor that
oozes out of its
tail."
81,6,9,"The electricity
emitted by the
units on each side of its body cause
it to become a
strong magnet."
82,6,9,"When many
MAGNETON gather
together, the resulting magnetic
storm disrupts
radio waves."
83,6,9,"In order to pre�
vent their
extinction, more people have made
an effort to breed
these POKeMON."
84,6,9,"It lives on a
grassy plain where
it can see a long way. If it sees an
enemy, it runs
away at 60 mph."
85,6,9,"An enemy that
takes its eyes off
any of the three heads--even for a
second--will get
pecked severely."
86,6,9,"The light blue fur
that covers it
keeps it protected against the cold.
It loves iceberg-
filled oceans."
87,6,9,"It sleeps under
shallow ocean
waters during the day, then looks
for food at night
when it's cold."
88,6,9,"When two of these
POKeMON's bodies
are combined together, new
poisons are
created."
89,6,9,"As it moves, a
very strong poison
leaks from it, making the ground
there barren for
three years."
90,6,9,"Clamping on to an
opponent reveals
its vulnerable parts, so it uses
this move only as
a last resort."
91,6,9,"Even a missile
can't break the
spikes it uses to stab opponents.
They're even hard�
er than its shell."
92,6,9,"It wraps its op�
ponent in its gas-
like body, slowly weakening its prey
by poisoning it
through the skin."

dark, planning to
take the life of the next living
thing that wanders
close by."

shadows at night,
it absorbs their heat. The chill it
causes makes the
victims shake."
95,6,9,"As it digs through
the ground, it
absorbs many hard objects. This is
what makes its
body so solid."
96,6,9,"When it twitches
its nose, it can
tell where someone is sleeping and
what that person
is dreaming about."
97,6,9,"The longer it
swings its
pendulum, the longer the effects
of its hypnosis
last."
98,6,9,"If it is unable
to find food, it
will absorb nutrients by
swallowing a
mouthful of sand."
99,6,9,"Its oversized claw
is very powerful,
but when it's not in battle, the
claw just gets in
the way."

of this POKeMON,
it was discovered that its compo�
nents are not

charges up, the
faster it gets. But this also
makes it more
likely to explode."

separated from the
group, the energy bond between the
six will make them
rejoin instantly."
103,6,9,"Living in a good
environment makes
it grow lots of heads. A head that
drops off becomes
an EXEGGCUTE."

after its birth.
It wears its mother's skull,
never revealing
its true face."
105,6,9,"Somewhere in the
world is a ceme�
tery just for MAROWAK. It gets
its bones from
those graves."

the Kick Master.
It uses its elastic legs to
execute every
known kick."
107,6,9,"To increase the
strength of all
its punch moves, it spins its arms
just before making
contact."
108,6,9,"It has a tongue
that is over 6�6��
long. It uses this long tongue to
lick its body
clean."
109,6,9,"If one gets close
enough to it when
it expels poison� ous gas, the gas
swirling inside it
can be seen."
110,6,9,"When it inhales
poisonous gases
from garbage, its body expands, and
its insides smell
much worse."

ning its drill-
like horn, it can easily shatter

the rough."

catch it for its
extremely nutritious eggs,

constantly moves
the vines that cover its body in
order to annoy its
opponent."
115,6,9,"To avoid
crushing the
baby it carries in its pouch, it
always sleeps
standing up."
116,6,9,"When they're in a
safe location,
they can be seen playfully tangling
their tails
together."

the young. If it
is approached, it uses its toxic
spikes to fend off
the intruder."
118,6,9,"During spawning
season, they swim
gracefully in the water, searching
for their perfect
mate."
119,6,9,"When autumn comes,
the males patrol
the area around their nests in
order to protect
their offspring."
120,6,9,"When the stars
twinkle at night,
it floats up from the sea floor, and
its body's center
core flickers."
121,6,9,"It is said that it
uses the seven-
colored core of its body to send
electric waves
into outer space."
122,6,9,"It uses the
mysterious
power it has in its fingers to
solidify air into
an invisible wall."
123,6,9,"It's very proud of
its speed. It
moves so fast that its opponent does
not even know what
knocked it down."
124,6,9,"It has several
different cry pat�
terns, each of which seems to
have its own
meaning."
125,6,9,"When two
ELECTABUZZ touch,
they control the electric currents
to communicate
their feelings."
126,6,9,"It moves more
frequently in hot
areas. It can heal itself by dipping
its wound into
lava."
127,6,9,"When the tempera�
ture drops at
night, it sleeps on treetops or
among roots where
it is well hidden."
128,6,9,"These violent
POKeMON fight
with other mem� bers of their herd
in order to prove

evolve into many
forms allows it to adapt smoothly
and perfectly to
any environment."

fins on the tip
of its tail to swim, it blends
with the water
perfectly."
135,6,9,"The negatively
charged ions
generated in its fur create a
constant sparking
noise."
136,6,9,"Once it has stored
up enough heat,
this POKeMON's body temperature
can reach up to
1700 degrees."
137,6,9,"An artificial
POKeMON created
due to extensive research, it can
perform only what
is in its program."
138,6,9,"In prehistoric
times, it swam on
the sea floor, eating plankton.
Its fossils are
sometimes found."
139,6,9,"Its heavy shell
allowed it to
reach only nearby food. This could
be the reason it
is extinct."
140,6,9,"Three hundred
million years ago,
it hid on the sea floor. It also has

that glow."

stomach is so
strong, even eating moldy or

POKeMON. As it
flies through the sky, it cools the
air, causing snow
to fall."
145,6,9,"Legendary bird
POKeMON. They say
lightning caused by the flapping of
its wings causes
summer storms."

POKeMON. It is
said to migrate from the south
along with the
spring."

ers of skin as it
grows larger. Dur� ing this process,
it is protected by
a rapid waterfall."

divine POKeMON.
When its entire body brightens
slightly, the
weather changes."
149,6,9,"It is said that
somewhere in the
ocean lies an island where these
gather. Only they
live there."
150,6,9,"Said to rest qui�
etly in an
undiscovered cave, this POKeMON was
created solely for
battling."
151,6,9,"Because it can
learn any move,
some people began research to see if
it is the ancestor
of all POKeMON."
152,6,9,"It loves to bask
in the sunlight.
It uses the leaf on its head to
seek out warm
places."
153,6,9,"The scent that
wafts from the
leaves on its neck causes anyone who
smells it to
become energetic."
154,6,9,"Anyone who stands
beside it becomes
refreshed, just as if they were
relaxing in a
sunny forest."

spouts from its
back burns hottest when it is angry.
The flaring flames
intimidate foes."

turns its back on
its opponent to demonstrate how
ferociously its
fire blazes."

body causes the
air around it to shimmer, this is a
sign that it is
ready to battle."
158,6,9,"This rough critter
chomps at any
moving object it sees. Turning your
back on it is not
recommended."
159,6,9,"The tips of its
fangs are slanted
backward. Once those fangs clamp
down, the prey has
no hope of escape."
160,6,9,"Although it has a
massive body, its
powerful hind legs enable it to move
quickly, even on
the ground."
161,6,9,"When acting as a
lookout, it warns
others of danger by screeching and
hitting the ground
with its tail."
162,6,9,"It lives in narrow
burrows that fit
its slim body. The deeper the nests
go, the more maze�
like they become."
163,6,9,"It begins to hoot
at the same time
every day. Some trainers use them
in place of
clocks."
164,6,9,"Its extremely soft
feathers make no
sound in flight. It silently sneaks
up on prey without
being detected."
165,6,9,"It is timid and
clusters together
with others. The fluid secreted by
its feet indicates
its location."
166,6,9,"In the daytime
when it gets warm,
it curls up inside a big leaf and
drifts off into
a deep slumber."
167,6,9,"If prey becomes
ensnared in its
nest of spun string, it waits
motionlessly until
it becomes dark."
168,6,9,"Rather than mak�
ing a nest in one
specific spot, it wanders in search
of food after
darkness falls."
169,6,9,"As a result of its
pursuit of faster,
yet more silent flight, a new set
of wings grew on
its hind legs."
170,6,9,"Its antennae, whi�
ch evolved from a
fin, have both po� sitive and neg�
ative charges flo�
wing through them."
171,6,9,"This POKeMON uses
the bright part of
its body, which changed from a
dorsal fin, to
lure prey."
172,6,9,"It is unskilled at
storing electric
power. Any kind of shock causes it to
discharge energy
spontaneously."
173,6,9,"If the impact site
of a meteorite is
found, this POKeMON is certain
to be within the
immediate area."
174,6,9,"Instead of walking
with its short
legs, it moves around by bouncing
on its soft,
tender body."
175,6,9,"It is considered
to be a symbol of
good luck. Its shell is said to
be filled with
happiness."
176,6,9,"Although it does
not flap its wings
very much, it can stay up in the air
as it tags along
after its trainer."

good at climbing
tree trunks and likes to eat the
new sprouts on
the trees."
178,6,9,"Once it begins to
meditate at sun�
rise, the entire day will pass
before it will
move again."
179,6,9,"It stores lots of
air in its soft
fur, allowing it to stay cool in
summer and warm
in winter."
180,6,9,"Because of its
rubbery, electric�
ity-resistant skin, it can store
lots of electric�
ity in its fur."
181,6,9,"When it gets dark,
the light from its
bright, shiny tail can be seen from
far away on the
ocean's surface."
182,6,9,"When these dance
together, their
petals rub against each other,
making pretty,
relaxing sounds."
183,6,9,"The fur on its
body naturally
repels water. It can stay dry, even
when it plays in
the water."
184,6,9,"The bubble-like
pattern on its
stomach helps it camouflage itself
when it's in the
water."
185,6,9,"If a tree branch
shakes when there
is no wind, it's a SUDOWOODO, not a
tree. It hides
from the rain."
186,6,9,"When it expands
its throat to
croak out a tune, nearby POLIWAG and
POLIWHIRL gather
immediately."
187,6,9,"It can be carried
away on even the
gentlest breeze. It may even float
all the way to the
next town."
188,6,9,"As soon as it
rains, it closes
its flower and hides in the shade
of a tree to avoid
getting wet."
189,6,9,"Even in the fierc�
est wind, it can
control its fluff to make its way to
any place in the
world it wants."
190,6,9,"It uses its tail
to hang on to tree
branches. It uses its momentum to
swing from one
branch to another."
191,6,9,"It is very weak.
Its only means of
defense is to shake its leaves
desperately at its
attacker."
192,6,9,"As the hot season
approaches, the
petals on this POKeMON's face
become more vivid
and lively."
193,6,9,"It can see in all
directions without
moving its big eyes, helping it
spot attackers and
food right away."
194,6,9,"A mucous
membrane covers
its body. Touching it barehanded will
cause a shooting
pain."
195,6,9,"Its body is always
slimy. It often
bangs its head on the river bottom
as it swims but
seems not to care."
196,6,9,"The tip of its
forked tail
quivers when it is predicting its
opponent's next
move."
197,6,9,"On the night of a
full moon, or when
it gets excited, the ring patterns
on its body glow
yellow."
198,6,9,"It hides any shiny
object it finds in
a secret location. MURKROW and
MEOWTH loot one
another's stashes."
199,6,9,"Every time it ya�
wns, SHELLDER
injects more poi� son into it. The
poison makes it
more intelligent."
200,6,9,"It loves to watch
people it's scar�
ed. It frightens them by screaming
loudly or appear�
ing suddenly."
201,6,9,"Because different
types of UNOWN
exist, it is said that they must
have a variety of
abilities."
202,6,9,"In order to con�
ceal its black
tail, it lives in a dark cave and
only moves about
at night."
203,6,9,"When it is in
danger, its tail
